Using sqoop, import products_replica table from MYSQL into hdfs such that fields are separated by a '*' and lines are separated by '\n'. Null values are represented as -1000 for numbers and "NA" for strings. Only records with product id less than or equal to 1111 should be imported and use 2 mappers for importing. The destination file should be stored as a text file to directory  /user/cloudera/problem5/products-text-part1. 

sqoop import \
--connect jdbc:mysql://quickstart.cloudera:3306/retail_db \
--username retail_dba \
--password cloudera \
--table products_replica \
--target-dir /user/cloudera/problem5/products-text-part1 \
--fields-terminated-by '*' \
--lines-terminated-by '\n' \
--null-string "NA" \
--null-non-string -1000 \
--where "product_id <= 1111" \
--num-mappers 2
