Using sqoop, import products_replica table from MYSQL into hdfs such that fields are separated by a '|' and lines are separated by '\n'. Null values are represented as -1 for numbers and "NOT-AVAILABLE" for strings. Only records with product id greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 1000 should be imported and use 3 mappers for importing. The destination file should be stored as a text file to directory  /user/cloudera/problem5/products-text.

sqoop import \
--connect jdbc:mysql://quickstart.cloudera:3306/retail_db \
--username retail_dba \
--password cloudera \
--table products_replica \
--target-dir /user/cloudera/problem5/products-text \
--fields-terminated-by "|" \
--lines-terminated-by "\n" \
--null-string "NOT-AVAILABLE" \
--null-non-string -1 \
--num-mappers 3 \
--where "product_id between 1 and 1000" 


sqoop eval \
--connect jdbc:mysql://quickstart.cloudera:3306/retail_db \
--username retail_dba \
--password cloudera \
--query "select * from products_replica limit 5"
