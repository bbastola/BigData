                        2. channels
                        3. sinks

agent has to be confiured in following ways:
1. assign names to the agent components
   a1.sources = r1  --> a1: agent name, r1 = sources name
2. describe/configure the source
    a1.sources.r1.type
    and other required configs 
3. describe/configure sink
    a1.sink.k1.type
    and other required configs
4.  describe/configure channel
    a1.channel.c1.type
    and other required configs
5.  Bind the source and sink to the channel
    a1.sources.r1.channels = c1
    a1.sinks.k1.channel = c1
