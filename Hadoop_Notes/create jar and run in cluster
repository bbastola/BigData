To create a jar and run it in a cluster

1. Make sure dependencies are same as in the cluster in build.sbt
2. Run sbt package to generate the jar file
	sbt package
3. scp jar file to the remote cluster
	scp jarname bbastola@gw01.itversity.com:~
	enter the password

4. Make sure input and output paths are valid
5. Build spark-submit command to pass
program name
master (if required)
additional parameters
class name
arguments such as input path, output path and environment
Run spark-submit command and validate output

	spark-submit \
	--class "class name" //get it from intellij(object name where there is main)
	--conf spark.ui.port=22222 \
	jar file name /input location /output location dev/prod

	eg:

	spark-submit \
	--class dailyRevenue \
	--conf spark.ui.port=22222 \
	wc_2.10-1.0.jar /user/bbastola/test/ /user/bbastola/output prop

	Note the location for input/output should be cluster NOT local
