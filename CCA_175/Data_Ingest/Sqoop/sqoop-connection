* We can make connection parameter file and pass the argument while running sqoop

open text editor and type the following and save(locally NOT in hdfs) it with any name. In my case: connection.props

---connect 
jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/retail_db
--username
retail_dba
-P
(make sure you enter those info on separate lines like above)

1. We can run simple query to demostrate

sqoop eval \
 --options-file connection.props \
 --query "select * from departments"

* we can also make a password file and pass it as a parameter for security purpose

- Go to Terminal and type => echo -n "password" > .password ("password" is your desired password, .password is the password file name)
- Put the above file in hdfs location => hadoop fs -copyFromLocal .password /user/bbastola/
- change the permission of the file => hadoop fs -chmod 400 /user/bbastola/.password
- remove the orginal file from local system => rmf .password

* Now let us run the sqoop job

sqoop eval \
--connect "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306"
--username=retail_dba
--password-file /user/bbastola/.password
--query "select * from departments"
